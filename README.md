## What it does

This app is a basic demonstration of MVC development. The concept is simple. The user can add a burger to the menu by typing a burger name into the field. When they click submit, the app adds that burger to the database and displays it on the menu. Each burger on the menu has a "Devour" button that when clicked, removes the burger from the menu to the "Devoured" section of the page. The app has minimal styling at this time, as it is primarily meant to demonstrate the backend. I may remedy this in the future.
